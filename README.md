Master Thesis of Tamas Freiberger on the topic "A Gamified Neural Network Learning Application for PhD Students"

To run the WebGL build in a browser, replace the index.html file of the build with the one found under src/ (for the functionality to load the progress from cookies).
Then host the build from a webserver (I an used Apache HTTP server). The website is not simple openable from file system.
