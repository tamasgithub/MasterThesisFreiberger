Master Thesis of Tamas Freiberger on the topic "A Gamified Neural Network Learning Application for PhD Students"

To run the WebGL build in a browser, replace the index.html file of the build with the one found under src/ (for the functionality to load the progress from cookies).
Then host the build from a webserver (I an used Apache HTTP server). The website is not simple openable from file system.

To run the MAC OS build, the application has to be marked as executable. The build was generated on Windows, that cannot set such a flag. Alternatively, the project can be built from a Unity Editor running on MAC OS already, then the build is ready to go.
